			<div class="col-md">
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Who can compete at Student Startup Cup?<p>
				<p>Student Startup Cup is open to any student currently enrolled in university OR high school at the time of the application. The team must also prove that they have existing users or revenue in order to compete. We reserve the disqualify you if you do not meet these requirements.</p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">What’s in it for my startup?</p>
				<p>Aside from winning the grand prize, it is a highly unique opportunity to network with some of the ecosystem’s leaders and to get your startup out to over 150 people at the grand finals. Moreover, it’s a rare chance to meet other like minded student entrepreneurs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md">
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Do we all have to attend all semi-finals, pitch workshop and grand finals if we get in? </p>
				<p>Yes, if your startup gets accepted, at least one member will have to represent your startup at all of these events. Otherwise, we may forfeit your place to another team. </p>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">Where are the semi-finals, pitch workshop and grand finals held?</p>
				<p>As each sponsor has kindly sponsored different aspects of the Student Startup Festival, all of these events will be held at different venues. These venues will be sent to you closer to the date. But don’t worry - they are all located centrally in Sydney CBD.</p>
